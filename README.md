# Reactive CRUD with Spring Boot and MongoDB

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a **reactive CRUD application** using **Spring Boot** and **MongoDB**. By leveraging **Spring WebFlux**, it provides a non-blocking, asynchronous approach to database operations. This application is ideal for scenarios that require scalable, real-time applications with high throughput

## Features
- **Reactive programming** with **Spring WebFlux** for non-blocking I/O operations.
- Integration of **Spring Data MongoDB Reactive** for asynchronous database access.
- Simple **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) via **RESTful APIs**.
- Supports a **reactive** approach for handling multiple concurrent requests efficiently.

## Technologies Used
- Java 8
- Spring Boot
- Spring WebFlux
- Spring Data MongoDB Reactive
- MongoDB
- Gradle
